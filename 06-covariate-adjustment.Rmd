# Covariate adjustment

## Odds ratio

- From FDA guidance: while the adjusted estimator for a conditional odds ratio generally has a larger standard error than an unadjusted estimator of the unconditional odds ratio, this is not necessarily a disadvantage because these can be estimators of two different parameters. The conditional odds ratio will generally be farther from 1 than the unconditional odds ratio, and therefore, adjustment for baseline covariates can increase the power of hypothesis testing for superiority despite the increased standard error of treatment effect estimation.
